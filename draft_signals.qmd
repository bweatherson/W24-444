# Introduction to Signaling Games

- Signaling games model **communication** between **senders** and **receivers** with potentially misaligned interests.
- These games are fundamental in **economics**, **biology**, and **political science**.
- They illustrate how signals can convey **information** and influence **decisions**.

# The Structure of a Signaling Game

- A Sender with private information chooses a **signal** to send.
- A Receiver observes the signal and takes an **action**.
- **Payoffs** depend on the action, signal, and the **true state of the world**.

# Applications of Signaling Games

- **Economics**: job-market signaling, product quality.
- **Biology**: warning colors in animals, mating signals.
- **Political Science**: crisis signaling, legislative signaling.

# Key Concepts in Signaling Games

- **Types**: Variations of the sender's private information.
- **Signals**: Observable actions or messages sent by the sender.
- **Actions**: Moves by the receiver in response to the signal.
- **Payoffs**: The outcome determining the utility for both parties.

# Examples of Signaling Games

- A job candidate signals competence through **educational qualifications**.
- A car seller uses a **warranty** to signal car quality to potential buyers.

# Equilibrium Concepts

- **Separating Equilibrium**: Different types send distinct signals.
- **Pooling Equilibrium**: All types send the same signal.
- **Semi-Separating Equilibrium**: Some but not all types send different signals.

# Challenges in Signaling Games

- Distinguishing between **honest** and **deceptive** signals.
- The existence and stability of **equilibria** in different games.
- Designing mechanisms or institutions to facilitate **efficient** signaling.

# Expanding the Model

- Introduction of **noise** in the signaling process.
- **Dynamic** signaling games, where signaling takes place over several periods.
- **Multi-sender** and/or **multi-receiver** signaling games.

# Conclusion

- Signaling games provide a rich theoretical framework to understand **strategic communication**.
- The evolution of **signaling strategies** depends on the structure of the game and **incentives** of the players.
- They remain an area of active research with vast applications.

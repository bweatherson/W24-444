Notes on Mehta

- Label invariance
- Just doing one-shot; does this affect realism?


Three hypotheses
- Primary salience: We just all have the same prejudices
    - Should introduce some pick and choose terminology
- Secondary salience: Levels approach
    - What is the base level; what is best, or what is most likely?
    - Note this is asymmetric; everyone is doing something they don't think the others are capable of doing.
- Schelling salience
    - Try to find a rule that if universalised would lead to this outcome
    - Very Kantian!

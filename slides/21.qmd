## Basic Idea

- Signaling games model **communication** between **senders** and **receivers** with potentially misaligned interests.

So we have three attributes:

1. A **state** provided by nature.
2. A **sender** who sees the state and sends a signal.
3. A **receiver** who sees the signal, but not the state, and acts.

## Basic Structure

- A Sender with private information chooses a **signal** to send.
- A Receiver observes the signal and takes an **action**.
- **Payoffs** depend on the action, signal, and the **true state of the world**.

## Simple Model

The English are advancing on the American positions around Boston (in 1775).

The priest at the Old North Church has the **information** about what the English are doing. (We will model the English not as actors, but as random.) The options are advance by Land or Sea.

He puts a **signal** in the church window, either one or two lanterns.

The **receiver**, Paul Revere, sees the lanterns, and rides tells the Americans to prepare for a land or sea assault.

## About This Diagram

We start at the center, at the open node.

The first thing that happens is Nature chooses one or other event to happen.

In this model there are only two possibilities: Land or Sea.

We'll occasionally generalise that, to Nature choosing a real-value (e.g., how many troops).

We'll assume both parties know the probability of each choice.

## Nature

Often we'll talk about Nature assigning a **type** to Sender.

This is a weird way to talk about the priest at the Old North Church.

But often the information we're interested in is some property of the sender.

## Sender

The next thing that happens is that Sender issues a signal.

In this game, Sender only has two options, though again we're going to want to generalise that in the future.

Note that Sender knows the information

## Receiver

Finally, receiver performs an action.

On the tree I've put a dashed circle around the nodes where receiver acts.

That means those nodes are part of the same **information set**.

An information set is a set of points which the person who is acting can't tell apart.

## Information Set

If you go back to the tree, there are two nodes in each of these sets.

What those nodes have in common is that the same signal is sent.

But the underlying state is different.

That means that receiver does know the signal, but doesn't know the state.

Paul Revere can see the church, but he can't see the British.

## Payouts

Finally, there are payouts for sender and receiver.

In this case, I've set the game up to be purely **co-operative**.

The sender (i.e., the priest), and the receiver (Paul Revere) both win if what Revere says to the army out at Concord matches what's actually happening.

We will **not** keep this co-operative notion around forever.

## Payouts

There are 16 payouts to set, and the probability for the two information kinds.

So even with 

## Activity

Go to <https://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu> and say that you're playing game pbw11.

You'll be randomly assigned sender or receiver, and you'll play the game on the next slide.

Note that A has probability 2/3 of being selected.


# Applications of Signaling Games

- **Economics**: job-market signaling, product quality.
- **Biology**: warning colors in animals, mating signals.
- **Political Science**: crisis signaling, legislative signaling.

# Key Concepts in Signaling Games

- **Types**: Variations of the sender's private information.
- **Signals**: Observable actions or messages sent by the sender.
- **Actions**: Moves by the receiver in response to the signal.
- **Payoffs**: The outcome determining the utility for both parties.

# Examples of Signaling Games

- A job candidate signals competence through **educational qualifications**.
- A car seller uses a **warranty** to signal car quality to potential buyers.

# Equilibrium Concepts

- **Separating Equilibrium**: Different types send distinct signals.
- **Pooling Equilibrium**: All types send the same signal.
- **Semi-Separating Equilibrium**: Some but not all types send different signals.

## Signaling Games

- Signaling games model **communication** between **senders** and **receivers** with potentially misaligned interests.

So we have three attributes:

1. A **state** provided by nature.
2. A **sender** who sees the state and sends a signal.
3. A **receiver** who sees the signal, but not the state, and acts.

## Basic Structure

- A Sender with private information chooses a **signal** to send.
- A Receiver observes the signal and takes an **action**.
- **Payoffs** depend on the action, signal, and the **true state of the world**.

## New Idea

Sometimes structures that look nothing like *signaling* in any traditional sense also have this exact structure.

All that we need is a situation where there are two parties with the following attributes:

1. The first party (a) has more information, and (b) moves first.
2. The second party (a) sees the move but not the information, and (b) performs an action whose value is affected by the underlying information.

## Asymmetries

In other words, all that we really need is:

- An information asymmetry (someone knows something and someone else doesn't);
- That is relevant (the value to each player of the outcome is sensitive to the information)'
- And where the more informed player moves first. 

## Markets

In ordinary life, something like this situation often occurs in **markets**.

It's really common for a seller to have more information about the thing they are selling than buyers do.

## Buyers and Sellers

So we can have a (stylised) situation where:

- Sellers know the quality of what they are selling;
- Buyers do not know the quality, but can observe (a) that the seller is interested in selling, and (b) what price they are offering to sell it for.

## Plan

Talk about 101 (full information, or at least symmetric information)

Talk about Akerlof (why it is a problem, old solutions, his solution with a two quality model, how you get realistic solutions with (a) forced sellers and (b) variable quality, why it went away)

Talk about veconlab game (three quality grades with producers making free choice, grade 2 is optimal for consumer surplus, with full information market tends to get there, actual structure is a bit complicated, with asymmetric information tends to end up at low grade)

Solutions (market for information, e.g, carfax; regulation; possible situations where regulation is good for business as a whole, but not for individual businesses; interesting political consequences of the latter)

## Signaling Games

- Signaling games model **communication** between **senders** and **receivers** with potentially misaligned interests.

So we have three attributes:

1. A **state** provided by nature.
2. A **sender** who sees the state and sends a signal.
3. A **receiver** who sees the signal, but not the state, and acts.

## Basic Structure

- A Sender with private information chooses a **signal** to send.
- A Receiver observes the signal and takes an **action**.
- **Payoffs** depend on the action, signal, and the **true state of the world**.

## New Idea

Sometimes structures that look nothing like *signaling* in any traditional sense also have this exact structure.

All that we need is a situation where there are two parties with the following attributes:

1. The first party (a) has more information, and (b) moves first.
2. The second party (a) sees the move but not the information, and (b) performs an action whose value is affected by the underlying information.

## Asymmetries

In other words, all that we really need is:

- An information asymmetry (someone knows something and someone else doesn't);
- That is relevant (the value to each player of the outcome is sensitive to the information)'
- And where the more informed player moves first. 

## Markets

In ordinary life, something like this situation often occurs in **markets**.

It's really common for a seller to have more information about the thing they are selling than buyers do.

## Buyers and Sellers

So we can have a (stylised) situation where:

- Sellers know the quality of what they are selling;
- Buyers do not know the quality, but can observe (a) that the seller is interested in selling, and (b) what price they are offering to sell it for.

## Econ 101

The standard supply-demand story you get taught in high school/econ 101 assumes symmetric information.

It doesn't strictly speaking assume full information.

You can still tell the standard story about the market for apples even if some apples might be rotten when you cut into them.

But you do need to assume that everyone has the same information about whether a particular apple is rotten.

# Akerlof

## George Akerlof

The reading today is a famous old paper by George Akerlof, which really introduced the idea that information asymmetries might be economically important.

Before that, there was kind of a thought that information asymmetries were like rationality failures; something that didn't have a place in equilibrium explanations.

Akerlof is now more famous for being Janet Yellen's husband, but we're looking back at why he was famous 50 years ago.

## Used Cars

Here are a striking pair of facts about the used car market throughout the 20th century. It is no longer a fact about the used car market, which is also striking if you know how prevalent it was.

- There was a deep market for used cars, and lots of people (including even relatively rich people) bought used cars.
- The resale value of a very recently purchased car was 70-80% of its new value.

## Unusual

Cars weren't the only assets for which these two claims held, but it was pretty unusual.

- Houses have a rich resale market, but they don't have a discount for used. (If anything there is a small premium for lightly used.)
- Other large items, especially furniture, had too thin a resale market.

## Explanations

- Raw bias for new cars?
- New car smell?
- Not wanting something other people had been in.

## Explanations

None of these work.

- The new car smell is gross, and probably poisonous.
- The not wanting other people in story would predict something we definitely do not see; a huge premium in the price of new **houses**.
- It would also predict that there would be a premium for cars which were never test driven, and we don't see that.

## Akerlof's Explanation

Assume the following stylised facts.

1. There is a big variation in the quality of cars, even from a given production line.
2. A lot of the variation can't be detected by visual inspection or a test drive.
3. But you can tell how good the car is by owning it for a few months. 

## Akerlof's Explanation

Putting those together, we get the following:

- Each token car has some quality that is known to seller and unknown to buyer.
- Seller decides whether to sell at the market price for used cars.
- Buyer doesn't know anything about the quality of the car, but does know that Seller chose to sell.

## Akerlof's Explanation

Given some plausible assumptions about the nature of the variation, this game has an equilibrium that looks like this:

- Sellers sell if their car is rather bad, and keep it otherwise.
- Buyers demand a huge discount to new cars to buy a used car, *because the car is probably bad*.
- The last point is because it wouldn't be for sale if it was good.

## Signals

The point is that putting the car up for sale is an  

## Plan

Talk about 101 (full information, or at least symmetric information)

Talk about Akerlof (why it is a problem, old solutions, his solution with a two quality model, how you get realistic solutions with (a) forced sellers and (b) variable quality, why it went away)

Talk about veconlab game (three quality grades with producers making free choice, grade 2 is optimal for consumer surplus, with full information market tends to get there, actual structure is a bit complicated, with asymmetric information tends to end up at low grade)

Solutions (market for information, e.g, carfax; regulation; possible situations where regulation is good for business as a whole, but not for individual businesses; interesting political consequences of the latter)

# Games

## Games

> - A **game** is any situation where the the outcome is determined by the actions of the players, plus perhaps some impact from the outside world.
> - If this seems really general, it is!

## Formal games

In a formal representation of a game we specify:

- How many players there are.
- How many moves they each have.
- What order those moves get made in.
- How many options they have at each move.
- What the payoff is for each player for each possible combination of moves by the players and 'moves' by nature.

## Two Main Types

- Each player makes 1 move, and these are made simultaneously.
- Players take turns making moves, and every move is revealed to all players when they are made.

## Other Types

> - Nature gets involved.
> - Nature gets involved and their move is only revealed to one of the players.
> - A move made by a player is not revealed to the other player(s) straight away.
> - Multiple sequential moves.

## Positive Sum Game

- These instances are a bit non-representative in one crucial respect.
- They are all **zero-sum**.
- That is, someone doing well means someone else must be doing worse.
- This is not the general case.

## Positive Sum Game

Most of the games we're going to look at have the following characteristic.

- There is a pair of possible outcomes such that every player is better off in the first outcome than the second.
- That is, is a pair of possible outcomes such that every player **gets more utility** in the first outcome than the second.

# Utility

## Game Outcomes

There are two natural ways to specify the outcome of a game.

> 1.  Describe the physical situation that results.
> 2.  Describe how much **utility** each player gets from that result.

## Utility

-   We are usually going to be focused on the second.
-   That's because we want to know what makes sense from the players' perspectives.
-   And just knowing the physical outcomes doesn't tell us that.

## What is Utility

-   It's not score.
-   The players are aiming to maximise their own number, not maximise the difference between the numbers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is Utility

-   The players would prefer a 3-4 result (i.e., 3 for them, 4 for other player) to a 2-1 result.
-   So this is very much unlike soccer, even though the numbers will often feel a lot like soccer scores.

## What is Utility

-   It's not money, for two distinct reasons.
-   First, the players might care how much money the other players get.
-   Second, the value of an extra dollar is different to different people. Typically, it has less value the richer one is.

## What is Utility

It is, more or less, desirability.

-   Outcome $O_1$ has more utility for player $X$ than outcome $O_2$ iff $X$ prefers to be in $O_1$ than $O_2$.

# 2 by 2 Games

## Three Famous Games

1. Prisoners' Dilemma
2. Stag Hunt
3. Hawk-Dove

## Prisoners' Dilemma

|          |    **C**    |   **D**  |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
|   **C**  |    3,3      |    0,5   |
|   **D**  |    5,0      |    1,1   |


----

|          |    **C**    |   **D**  |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
|   **C**  |    3,3      |    0,5   |
|   **D**  |    5,0      |    1,1   |


- Each player can choose **C** or **D**.
- If both choose **C**, both get 3.
- If both choose **D**, both get 1.
- If they make different choices, the one who chose **D** gets 5, and the other gets 0.

## Prisoners' Dilemma

The big tension:

- Both doing **C** makes both better off than both doing **D**.
- Whatever the other person does, each person is better off doing **D** than **C**.

## Question

What real life situations might be like this? I.e., which real life situations have these features:

- There is an option that leaves everyone fairly well off if everyone does it.
- There is another option that leaves everyone badly off if everyone does it.
- No matter what everyone else does, each person is better off doing the second thing.

## iClicker

Were you able to register:

A.  Yes
B.  No

I'll change the numbers to allow the game to start.

## Instructions

You'll be randomly paired with someone else in the room, and you'll play Prisoners' Dilemma 5 times. After each play, you'll see what the other person did the previous round.

Your aim is to get as many points (or 'dollars') as possible over the five rounds.

## Instructions

You'll be randomly assigned Row or Column; the game is symmetric so this doesn't make a different to strategy.

## Feedback

- How did it go?
- What strategies did you use?

## Stag Hunt

|          |    **C**    |   **D**  |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
|   **C**  |    20,20    |    0,20  |
|   **D**  |    15,0     |   15,15  |

- Two **equilibria**.
- Both play C is more beneficial. D no longer **dominates**.
- But D is **safer**.

## Instructions

Go back into veconlab, and you should be set up with a different person from the PD rounds to play a **single** round of Stag Hunt.

## Feedback

- How did it go?
- Why did you play what you did?

## Hawk-Dove

|          |    **C**    |   **D**    |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
|   **C**  |    0,0      |    0,1     |
|   **D**  |    1,0      |   -20,-20  |

- No (pure strategy) **equilibrium**.
- If the other plays C, a small gain to playing D.
- But if you both play D, watch out.

## Instructions

Go back into veconlab, and you should be set up with a different person again from the last two rounds to play a 5 rounds of Hawk-Dove.

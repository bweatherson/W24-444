# The Basic Game

## Prisoners' Dilemma

Basic Challenge:

- Each player is better off defecting;
- The players are collectively better off if both cooperate.

## Tragedy of the Commons

- In a two-player setting, we normally call this Prisoners' Dilemma, or PD.
- In a multi-player setting it's sometimes called the Tragedy of the Commons.
- Though note this name traces back to Garret Hardin, who had some _problematic_ associations.

## Tragedy of the Commons

- The story (which is wildly ahistorical) is that everyone grazed their herds on the commons - which was a private good to get cheap food - but collectively this made the commons unusable.
- And in the standard story, private property was the solution to the tragedy.
- For the real story, see the work Eleanor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for a few years back.

## Social Challenge

- How do we get to cooperation?
- First question is whether in this case we should want to get to cooperation.
- Second question is whether this really is PD.
- Let's assume that the answer in each case is _yes_, what do we do.

## Change the Payouts

One possible social response is to change the payouts.

- _Snitches get stiches_ is kind of a version of this response.

## Change the Options

Another is to make it just impossible for everyone to do the defecting move.

- Enclosures are sort of like this.
- Just like with signaling games, the difference between making something expensive and making it impossible is a little vague, but it's useful conceptually to think of them as separate options.

## Iterate the Game

- But the simplest way to handle this kind of problem is to iterate the game.
- Arguably it is in everyone's interests to be cooperative if they will have to interact with the other players repeatedly.

## The One Shot Game

Axelrod worked with this version of Prisoners' Dilemma (PD).

|          |    **C**    |   **D**  |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
|   **C**  |    3,3      |    0,5   |
|   **D**  |    5,0      |    1,1   |

The trick was that each pair of people would play an iterated version of this game.

## Indefinite Iteration

In the fancier version of the game, he didn't tell people how long the game would go.

- Instead he just said there was a probability of it ending after each round; if I recall 0.005.
- This was used to avoid backwards induction reasoning, but it was unnecessary.

## The Tournament

- There are *n* strategies submitted.
- Strategies are not quite full strategies in our sense; they just say what to do given what the other player did. (They don't account for possible errors in their own performance.)
- Each will play *k* rounds of PD with each of the other *n*-1 strategies.
- Their payouts will add up over the $k(n-1)$ rounds and the one with the highest total will win.

## Cooperative and Competitive

- This is not entirely a cooperative game; ultimately if I'm a strategy I want to win, and that means I want the other strategy I'm interaction with to lose.
- But in the short run there is much to be gained by improving our mutual position vs the other $n-2$ strategies.
- So in the short run there is a benefit to cooperation, even if we're ultimately rivals.

## The First Tournament

- Axelrod advertised the first round of his tournament, and called for submissions.
- This was far from trivial in pre-internet days, and he only got 13 submissions.
- In the first tournament he said that $k$ would be 100, but no one actually exploited that fact.

## The Winner

Tit-for-Tat

## Tit-for-Tat

Two rules.

1. Play C at round 1.
2. In all subsequent rounds, do whatever the other player just did.

## The Second Tournament

- So Axelrod wrote this up, including saying who won.
- He called for more submissions, and now got 66.
- Some of these were typed, some came to Ann Arbor on the huge magnetic disks that were used way back then.
- He ran the tournament again, this time with a random number of rounds. \pause
- And Tit-for-Tat won again.

## Logic and Victory

- This doesn't mean Tit-for-Tat is the best strategy.
- Indeed, in each tournament it was easy in retrospect to describe strategies that would have beaten everyone, including TFT, if they had been entered.
- But still, it's pretty impressive.

## Four Features

Tit-for-Tat has five striking characteristics, each of which was positively correlated with success in the tournaments.

- Nice
- Provocable
- Forgiving
- Not envious
- Simple

## Nice

The clearest distinction in the tournament was between strategies that were Nice and those that were Nasty.

- By definition, a strategy is Nice iff it is never the first to defect.
- You don't have to be very nice in the intuitive sense to count as Nice.

## Grim Trigger

Here is one nice strategy, one Axelrod calls Grim Trigger.

::::: {.nonincremental}
1. Cooperate on move 1.
2. If the other player ever defects, defect on every subsequent move.
:::::

This strategy did really badly; it was the worst Nice strategy in round 2. But still many Nasty strategies did worse.

## Nice Strategies

- In the evolutionary versions of the game, there can be a tendency for strategies to tend towards being Nice.
- Then evolution stops, because when two Nice strategies meet, the payout is inevitably 3k to each.
- Although the best strategies are all Nice, it is how they interact with Nasty strategies that determines who wins.

## Provocable

- It's bad to get pushed around.
- Nasty strategies are always looking for how much they can get away with.
- So you want to send a clear message that defections will not be tolerated.
- Obviously TFT does that.

## Forgiving

- But you don't want to be Grim Trigger.
- It's bad to be pushed around, but it's not much better to end up in all defect land.
- You need a way back to all cooperate land.
- TFT has that, though notably it isn't perfect at this.
- TFT can get into CD-DC-CD-etc cycles with a bunch of strategies.

## Not Envious

- In any interaction, TFT never does better than who it is playing with.
- Yet it comes out first overall.
- This is kind of amazing.
- It just does not care at all about winning against who it is facing off with.

## Not Envious To a Fault

- Note that TFT doesn't always do that well in evolutionary games.
- This is because it might take this a bit too far.
- It doesn't look to exploit weaknesses in opponents.


## Simple

- Other strategies try to figure out what their rivals are doing.
- They normally get this wrong. 
- Or they try and send complex signals.
- These are usually misinterpreted. 
- TFT keeps things simple, and doesn't lose points messing around looking for any edges.

## Variant Games

- The most interesting variant to me is the one where a strategy only gets implemented with probability 0.99 on each move.
- Sometimes there are performance errors.
- TFT does terribly in this; it can't get out of randomly generated defection cycles.

## Variant Games

- In this kind of game you need to be a bit more forgiving.
- But also you can try to get away with a bit more; if the other person will treat a defection as random, you can plan a few.
